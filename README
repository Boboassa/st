# Boboassa's build of st the simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


## Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    `make clean install`


## Running st

If you did not install st with `make clean install`, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    `tic -sx st.info`

See the man page for additional details.
